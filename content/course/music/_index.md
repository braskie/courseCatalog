## Mission Statement

The Sun Prairie music program will provide all students the opportunity to achieve musical excellence through a variety of musical experiences. Students will learn valuable life skills, grow aesthetically, feel successful, and create connections that will establish a lifelong appreciation of music.

## Music at Sun Prairie High Schools

The music curricula at Sun Prairie High Schools is designed to expand a student’s insight into music. Multiple performing ensembles and non-performance courses give students many opportunities to study music. Studies have shown the importance of creativity and the arts. Sensitivity to, and understanding of, music will give a student a lifelong appreciation of one of the world’s greatest art forms.
Participation in band, choir, and/or orchestra provides for the following instruction:

1. Small group lesson curriculum (instrument or voice specific)
1. Ensemble class learning
1. One credit toward graduation is earned per year

Students who enroll in band, choir, and/or orchestra are expected to attend and participate in performances scheduled outside
of regular class time. Ensembles of any size require people to work together seamlessly; repetitive absences hinder the ability
to understand and work with ensembles as a whole. Repetitive tardiness and/or unexcused absences (class/lessons), therefore,
will result in the loss of performance privileges.
